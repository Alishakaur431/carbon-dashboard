1. Deciding what to show on the main page vs details
On the main page, I focused on showing the most essential information at a glance—the key stats, quick actions, and summary of credits. Anything that requires deeper analysis or additional context, like detailed credit history or usage breakdown, was moved to the details page. This way, users can quickly understand the state of their account without feeling overwhelmed.

2. Design choices to keep it clean
I aimed for simplicity and clarity. I used consistent spacing, minimal colors, and clear typography to make the interface easy on the eyes. Key actions are highlighted, but unnecessary information is hidden until needed. Overall, the goal was to create a layout that feels intuitive and uncluttered.

3. Keeping the dashboard fast with 10,000 credits
If the system had a large amount of data, like 10,000 credits, I would implement lazy loading, pagination, or data virtualization so that the dashboard only loads what’s visible to the user. Caching frequently accessed data and optimizing queries would also help maintain fast performance, ensuring a smooth experience even with large datasets.
